# Wally's Adventure

Train game similar to the Google Dinosaur game for my IMM 280 Class ('22)

This is a reskin and update of the game created by Chris Deacy. You can find his repo [here](https://github.com/chrisdothtml/chrome-dino)
He features an almost identical Chrome dinosaur game and we changed the sprites to be more
train themed after Wally the Whistle
